          The Workforce Profiles Report allows users to explore statistics on
          the representation of designated equity groups across the BC Public
          Service (BCPS) workforce, including representation of Women,
          Indigenous Peoples, Persons with Disabilities and members of Visible
          Minorities.

          You can navigate between sections using the named tabs at the top of
          this area. You can also refine the visualizations and tables on each
          tab by employing one or more filters from the available list â€” on most
          screens, these filters will be shown to the left (in blue). For mobile
          devices, filters instead appear in a hidden menu above the page tabs;
          click on the &ldquo;Show variables&rdquo; button to display them, or
          the &ldquo;Hide variables&rdquo; button to minimize them again. Note
          that not all filters are available to be used on every tab.

          <strong>Note</strong>: the Workforce Profile Dashboard is not
          compatible with older web browsers such as Internet Explorer 11.
          Please use an up-to-date browser when accessing the Dashboard for best
          results.

        <h2>Caveats</h2>
        <p>
          The Workforce Profiles Report is produced using demographic data
          obtained on recent corporate employee surveys, including the Work
          Environment Survey (WES). The dashboard is updated after each
          completed WES cycle (approximately every two years).
        </p>
        <p>
          BC Stats takes great care to protect the individual identities of BCPS
          employees. Some results in the dashboard have been suppressed in order
          to protect small counts and maintain employee confidentiality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some tabs make comparisons to previous year results (e.g., Indicators
          of Progress). Please be advised that BC Stats recalculates the
          previous cycle&rsquo;s results in these comparisons using the most up
          to date demographic and organizational information available, to
          improve comparisons. As a result, the data used in comparisons to
          previous cycles may appear differently than that reported in
          historical reports. BC Stats does retain all previous Workforce
          Profiles reports, but for historical purposes only; caution is advised
          when comparing across reports.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that while BC Stats collects employee information on LGBTQ2S+
          identity, as well as on non-binary gender identities, the Workforce
          Profiles do not presently include this information as no federal data
          on BC Population or Available Workforce exists for comparison. At this
          time, the tool includes both cis and trans women in the Women
          category.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: Statistics Canada and BC Stats use different methods to identify
          Persons with Disabilities. BC Stats currently uses a definition from
          the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, focusing
          on those with long-term impairments that interact with barriers.
          Statistics Canada uses a series of census and other survey questions
          to identify Persons with Disabilities, which may encompass a wider
          portion of the population. Please use caution when comparing the rates
          of Persons with Disabilities in the BC Public Service (calculated by
          BC Stats) against the available workforce and population of BC
          (calculated by Statistics Canada).
